# Research Statement 

At the lab on 10 January 2013, we met to discuss modernist "case studies" on versioning, with an emphasis on why modernism (broadly understood) is a relevant and curious domain / period for versioning research.  

In short: what about modernism demands versioning? What kinds of versioning? And through what methods? 

To unpack answers to these questions, let's begin with a "research statement" for each of our case studies (currently framed by references to authors): Proust, Conrad, and Moore. 

A research statement should include the following: 

## Rationale for Selected Author(s) and Selected Text(s) (~250 words) 

What about this author's work begs for versioning? What are some material and/or historical reasons to justify a claim for versioning? For instance, how did the author's work change over time? Or how does a given literary technique or mechanism change within a given text? 

## The Text(s) to Be Versioned 

Ideally, they are in TXT format. If you have them in TEI-XML or HTML, then that's great, too. 

Please think small. If you are working with a novel, then do not pick the entire novel. Keep the selections brief (a page, even). Do not version anything longer than a chapter (for now).  

Assuming there are no intellectual property or rights issues, we'll push these selections to our GitHub repo.  

## Rationale for the Selected Text(s) (~100 words)

Why are you selecting these texts? Or these portions of a text? What other options / editions / translations exist that you did not select? In the last instance, how do you justify your selection(s)? 

## The Working Definition of a Version in this Instance (no more than three sentences) 

As we have learned, there are multiple ways of defining a version, and of versioning texts and other media. In this instance, what is your definition? Ideally, the definition is tied to method. It should help you practice versioning (not just describe the practice).  

## One Concrete Example of Why Versioning Will Be Interesting (~100 words) 

Draw an example from the text(s) that demonstrate or exhibit your claims above (e.g., why the selected texts(s) warrant versioning). Ideally, the example will convince (or at least appeal to) people who may not be familiar with your selected text(s).  

## A Proposed Workflow (~100 words) 

Based on the work you've done thus far, what would be the exact (i.e., step-by-step) procedure for versioning the selected text(s)? Will you use TEI? If so, then when? How will you visualize meaningful difference? What tools will you use? Feel free to adopt something we've already done or articulate a new / variant workflow.

However, please propose a workflow that is feasible within the next month or so. Avoid blue sky.   

*Reminder:* the point here is to underscore multiple ways of versioning modernist texts (meaning there is an array of possible workflows), while justifying modernism as an interesting area for versioning research.  

## Anticipated Outcomes (~100 words) 

What new lines of inquiry or interpretations do you believe will emerge from versioning the selected text(s)? And how will or could the versions / interpretations you produce be interoperable? For instance, how could someone discover and integrate your work (perhaps literally) into their own research? 

*Quick note: please write portions or even all of this in such a way that it could ultimately be published on the lab's blog.* For now, there's no need to preoccupy yourself with the details of your writing; however, you should keep in mind that we would like to make the development of these case studies public.
